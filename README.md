## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Mehedi Hasan, a MERN Full Stack Developer . **Front End Web Developer** (specializing in **React Applications**) and a **Back End Web Developer** (specializing in **Node Js**)

👨‍💻 I enjoy contributing to **Open Source Projects**. I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. In 2022, I learned **React.js**, **Node.js**, **React Native**, **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. I got started with [**Crypto Mehedi**](https://cryptomehedi.com) quite recently and made a name for myself.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills.
